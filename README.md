**Instructions**   
Drag the elevator prefab into your scene and then **unpack it**   
Unity doesn't like deleting gameobjects in prefabs.

Any time you make a change (floor positions, time it takes, etc) click "Reset" then "Create"

If you want to edit the elevator doors, change the "Door prefab" object and it will apply to all other doors when you reset and create. Same goes for the Button and Calling Button Prefab

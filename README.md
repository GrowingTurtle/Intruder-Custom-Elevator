**Instructions**
Drag the elevator prefab into your scene and then **unpack it**   
Unity doesn't like deleting gameobjects in prefabs.

Any time you make a change (floor positions, time it takes, etc) click "Reset" then "Create"



If you want to edit the elevator door animations, change the "Door prefab" object
